### What is Selenium

Selenium is one of the most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite.It was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an internal tool at Thought Works. Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms and programming languages.

Selenium can be easily deployed on platforms such as Windows, Linux, Solaris and Macintosh. Moreover, it supports OS (Operating System) for mobile applications like iOS, windows mobile and android.

Selenium supports a variety of programming languages through the use of drivers specific to each language.Languages supported by Selenium include C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.Currently, Selenium Web driver is most popular with Java and C#. Selenium test scripts can be coded in any of the supported programming languages and can be run directly in most modern web browsers. Browsers supported by Selenium include Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari.

Selenium can be used to automate functional tests and can be integrated with automation test tools such as Maven, Jenkins, & Docker to achieve continuous testing. It can also be integrated with tools such as TestNG, & JUnit for managing test cases and generating reports.

### Selenium Features

* Selenium is an open source and portable Web testing Framework.
* Selenium IDE provides a playback and record feature for authoring tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.
* It can be considered as the leading cloud-based testing platform which helps testers to record their actions and export them as a reusable script with a simple-to-understand and easy-to-use interface.
* Selenium supports various operating systems, browsers and programming languages. Following is the list: <br>
             Programming Languages: C#, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, and JavaScript <br>
             Operating Systems: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris. <br>
             Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Opera, Safari, etc.
* It also supports parallel test execution which reduces time and increases the efficiency of tests.
* Selenium can be integrated with frameworks like Ant and Maven for source code compilation.
* Selenium can also be integrated with testing frameworks like TestNG for application testing and generating reports.
* Selenium requires fewer resources as compared to other automation test tools.
* WebDriver API has been indulged in selenium whichis one of the most important modifications done to selenium.
* Selenium web driver does not require server installation, test scripts interact directly with the browser.
* Selenium commands are categorized in terms of different classes which make it easier to understand and implement.
* Selenium Remote Control (RC) in conjunction with WebDriver API is known as Selenium 2.0. This version was built to support the vibrant web pages and Ajax.
